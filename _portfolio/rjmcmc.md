This research focused on filtering active states from unlabeled wearable sensor measurements. I show you the result directly so that you can understand the motivation better.

The left panel show the raw signal data from a wearable device called `Actigraph'. It measures the acceleration of a wearer's body movement and is used for physical activity analysis. The problem arises when we do not have any labels for this dataset, i.e., we do not know what a wearer was doing at a give period of time.
