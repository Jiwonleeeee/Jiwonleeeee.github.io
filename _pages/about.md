I am a 4th-year Ph.D. candidate at the University of Cincinnati, supervised by Dr. Hang J. Kim. My research is mainly focused on Bayesian inference, particularly Bayesian computation for large datasets, advanced MCMC algorithms, Gaussian processes, and their applications in climate and automated sensor data.
