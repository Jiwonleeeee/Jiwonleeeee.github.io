I am a 4th-year Ph.D. candidate at the University of Cincinnati under the supervision of Dr. Hang J. Kim. My research interests broadly focus on Bayesian inference, specifically Bayesian computation for large datasets, advanced MCMC algorithms, Gaussian process, and their application to climate and automated sensor data.
